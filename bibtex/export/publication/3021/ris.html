N2  - Multi-label classification is the task in Machine Learning to assign more than one label to an instance.
Opposite to the single-label classification problem, where only a binary or a multi-class can be assigned to
an instance, dependencies may exist between different labels in a multi-label problem. These dependencies
can be used to improve the classification task and help to better understanding the multi-label dataset. A
Separate-and-Conquer Multi-Label Rule Learner was proposed 2016 by Eneldo Loza Menc√≠a and Frederik
Janssen, that learn multi-label dependency and use them in the classification task. In this work we made
some extensions of the proposed algorithm and evaluate them.
