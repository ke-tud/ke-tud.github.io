      abstract = {Multi-label Bird Species ClassiÔ¨Åcation competition provides an excellent oppor-
tunity to analyze the effectiveness of acoustic processing and mutlilabel learning. We propose an unsupervised feature extraction and generation approach based on latest advances in deep neural network learning, which can be applied generically to acoustic data.  With state-of-the-art approaches from multilabel learning, we achieved top positions in the competition, only surpassed by teams with profound expertise in acoustic data processing.}
