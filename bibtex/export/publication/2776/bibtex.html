   abstract = {In this paper, we examine a simple approach to zero-shot multi-label
text classification, i.e., to the problem of predicting multiple, possibly previously
unseen labels for a document. In particular, we propose to use a semantic embed-
ding of label and document words and base the prediction of previously unseen
labels on the similarity between the label name and the document words in this em-
bedding. Experiments on three textual datasets across various domains show that
even such a simple technique yields considerable performance improvements over
a simple uninformed baseline.}
