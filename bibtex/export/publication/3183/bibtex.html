   abstract = {In this paper, we present a new approach to Approximate Query Processing (AQP) called Model-based AQP that leverages deep generative models learned over a dataset to answer SQL queries at interactive speeds. Different from classical AQP approaches, deep generative models allow us not only to compute approximate responses to ad-hoc queries even over rare sub-populations but additionally support a new class of queries called counterfactual queries enabling users to ask what-if queries. Furthermore, we think that deep generative models can not only be used for AQP in databases but also have other applications for problems such as Query Optimization as well as Data Cleaning.}
