N2  - The primary goal of the research reported in this paper is to identify what criteria are
responsible for the good performance of a heuristic rule evaluation function in a greedy topdown covering algorithm. We rst argue that search heuristics for inductive rule learning
algorithms typically trade off consistency and coverage, and we investigate this trade-off by
determining optimal parameter settings for five different parametrized heuristics. In order
to avoid biasing our study by known functional families, we also investigate the potential of
using meta-learning for obtaining alternative rule learning heuristics. The key results of this
experimental study are not only practical default values for commonly used heuristics and a
broad comparative evaluation of known and novel rule learning heuristics, but we also gain
theoretical insights into factors that are responsible for a good performance. For example,
we observe that consistency should be weighed more heavily than coverage, presumably
because a lack of coverage can later be corrected by learning additional rules.
