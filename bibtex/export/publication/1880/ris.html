N2  - Rule learning is known for its descriptive and therefore comprehensible classification models which also yield good class predictions.  For different classification models, such as decision trees, a variety of techniques for obtaining good probability estimates have been proposed and evaluated. However, so far, there has been no systematic empirical study of how these techniques can be adapted to probabilistic rules and how these methods affect the probability-based rankings. In this paper we apply several basic methods for the estimation of class membership probabilities to classification rules. We also study the effect of a shrinkage technique for merging the probability estimates of rules with those of their generalizations. Finally, we compare different ways of combining probability estimates from an ensemble of rules. Our results show that for probability estimation it is beneficial to exploit the fact that rules overlap (i.e., rule averaging is preferred over rule sorting),
and that individual probabilities should be combined at the level of rules and not at the level of theories.
