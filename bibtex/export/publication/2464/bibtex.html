  abstract = {In this thesis we will show the application of support-vector-machines to multilabel hierarchical datasets, built in the commonly known process of bookmark classification. Therefore we will propose two approaches for the multilabel classification. Finally we will show that the predicted multilabel rankings can be evaluated for the different levels of the hierarchy.},
