   abstract = {In this paper, we compare and combine two approaches for
multi-label classication that both decompose the initial problem into
sets of smaller problems. The Calibrated Label Ranking approach is
based on interpreting the multi-label problem as a preference learning
problem and decomposes it into a quadratic number of binary classiers.
The HOMER approach reduces the original problem into a hierarchy of
considerably simpler multi-label problems. Experimental results indicate
that the use of HOMER is benecial for the pairwise preference-based
approach in terms of computational cost and quality of prediction.}
