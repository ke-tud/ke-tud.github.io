   abstract = {Exploiting dependencies between labels is considered to be crucial for multi-label classification. Rules are able to expose label dependencies such as implications, subsumptions or exclusions in a human-comprehensible and interpretable manner. However, the induction of rules with multiple labels in the head is particularly challenging, as the number of label combinations which must be taken into account for each rule grows exponentially with the number of available labels. To overcome this limitation, algorithms for exhaustive rule mining typically use properties such as anti-monotonicity or decomposability in order to prune the search space. In the present paper, we examine whether commonly used multi-label evaluation metrics satisfy these properties and therefore are suited to prune the search space for multi-label heads.}
