N2  - In multi-label classification, where the evaluation of predic-tions  is  less  straightforward  than  in  single-label  classification,  variousmeaningful, though different, loss functions have been proposed. Ideally,the learning algorithm should be customizable towards a specific choiceof the performance measure. Modern implementations of boosting, mostprominently gradient boosted decision trees, appear to be appealing fromthis point of view. However, they are mostly limited to single-label clas-sification, and hence not amenable to multi-label losses unless these arelabel-wise decomposable. In this work, we develop a generalization of thegradient boosting framework to multi-output problems and propose analgorithm for learning multi-label classification rules that is able to min-imize decomposable as well as non-decomposable loss functions. Usingthe well-known Hamming loss and subset 0/1 loss as representatives, weanalyze the abilities and limitations of our approach on synthetic dataand evaluate its predictive performance on multi-label benchmarks.
