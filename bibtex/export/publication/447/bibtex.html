   abstract = {We describe the poker agent AKI-RealBot which participated in the 6-player Limit Competition of the third Annual AAAI Computer Poker Challenge in 2008. It finished in second place, its performance being mostly due to its superior ability to exploit weaker bots. This paper describes the architecture of the program and the Monte-Carlo decision tree-based decision engine that was used to make the botâ€™s decision. It will focus the attention on the modifications which made the bot successful in exploiting weaker bots.}
