     abstract = {The poker agent AKI-REALBOT described in this paper was designed to participate in the 6-player Limit competition which was part of the Computer Poker Challenge at the AAAI 2008 conference.It ended up in second place, its performance being mostly due to its ability to exploit weaker bots and still play fairly well against stronger players. This paper describes
the architecture of the program and the Monte-Carlo decision tree-based decision engine that was used to make the botâ€™s
decision. It will focus the attention on the modifications which made the bot successful in exploiting weaker bots.}
